# Iris Dataset Exploring & Visualization

# Task Objective
Explore and visualize the Iris dataset using Python, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

# Approach
- Loaded and inspected the Iris dataset using `pandas` and `seaborn`.
- Created visualizations:
  - Scatter plot to explore relationships
  - Histogram for distribution analysis
  - Box plot to detect outliers
- Summarized each visualization with insights.

#  Results & Insights
- Setosa is clearly distinguishable by sepal and petal features.
- Petal length and width are strong indicators of species.
- KDE curves and box plots helped in understanding data distribution and outliers.
